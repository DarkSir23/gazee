### Contributing to Gazee

There's a not a lot of rules currently.

1. If you can make it better, do it.

This is my first real project, and as such, I'm sure it's currently full of wonkiness and very unpythonic things. If you can do it better, please do so. All contributions, no matter how small are super appreciated.

2. Style kind of matters.

I'd like to adhere to PEP8 as much as possible. I know I'm violating it currently with my constant jumping of styles for variable/function names, but I will eventually sort this to adhere to the guidelines and I expect any new code coming in to adhere to the guidelines. Particularly so my style checker doesn't annoy me as I go to save each file.

3. Be nice to other contribuiters.

If someone else gets to your feature idea fix first or cleans something up you were working on, don't berate them in their PR or issue thread. We're all working for the betterment of the project and for Open Source as a whole. Let's act as a community and support each other. Perhaps your dialogue can reach a better soultion with all of your minds working towards the end goal rather than the means of getting there.

So far that's it. Pretty simple right? Happy Hacking, and Happy Reading!
